 /oauth2/token

Returns an OAuth access token and refresh token using the authorization_code or refresh_token grant type.

When grant_type is authorization_code:

With the code flow, provide code, client_id, and client_secret.
With the PKCE flow, provide code, client_id, and code_verifier.
When grant_type is refresh_token:

With the code flow, provide refresh_token, client_id, and client_secret. The response returns the same refresh token provided in the request.
With the PKCE flow, provide refresh_token and client_id. The response returns a new refresh token.
You can use the scopes parameter to limit the set of permissions authorized by the access token. You can use the short_lived parameter to create an access token that expires in 24 hours.

Important: OAuth tokens should be encrypted and stored on a secure server. Application clients should never interact directly with OAuth tokens.
