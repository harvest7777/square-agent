# Overview

Code style guidelines for consistent Python development.

## Naming Conventions

- Always use snake_case for function names and variable names
- Never use camelCase or PascalCase for functions or variables

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to helper functions when their use is not immediately obvious
- Docstrings should explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised
